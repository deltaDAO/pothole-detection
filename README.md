# Pothole Detection Dataset

Here we provide a dataset of 1,243 pothole images which have been annotated as per the YOLO labeling format.

We provide the image and the corresponding labeling in the dataset. We have collected the images of potholes from the web consisting of diverse regions. Here is the directory structure for the dataset:
